00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.675
Hi, and welcome back.

2
00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:11.620
In this video, I'll
take you through

3
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.710
the key features of GitHub
Copilot inline chat,

4
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.485
and show you how to prompt
inline to get suggestions.

5
00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:22.860
Now, let's start using
GitHub Copilot inline chat.

6
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.920
If you're following along,

7
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.490
let's open Lesson 1,

8
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.425
Video 4, problem,

9
00:00:28.425 --> 00:00:31.920
addition, and the
subtraction file.

10
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.775
Now let's close the panel.

11
00:00:34.775 --> 00:00:37.350
Inline chat has a few advantages

12
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.310
over the traditional
chat window.

13
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.150
You don't need to switch
between the chat and the code.

14
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.710
The suggestions show
up right in your code.

15
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.070
You can accept or reject
those suggestions.

16
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.570
But like most things,

17
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.150
it depends on the use
case and your workflow.

18
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.190
There are two ways that you can

19
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.440
open inline chat in VS Code.

20
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.290
You can right click
the Copilot from

21
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.290
the menu and select inline chat,

22
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.910
or you can use a
keyboard shortcut,

23
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.370
which is command i for Mac.

24
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.770
Notice how Copilot
picked up on the error.

25
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.180
When I open the inline chat,

26
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.840
it prepopulated a prompt
to fix the error,

27
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.720
which saves me time.

28
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.650
Another way that I
can interact with

29
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.660
Copilot is by using the
voice command here.

30
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.620
This may come in
hand if you have

31
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.645
a need for it or if you
just don't want to type.

32
00:01:32.645 --> 00:01:34.600
Now it's time to
fix the problem.

33
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.830
I'll just open inline
chat with the shortcut,

34
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.060
hit "Enter", and
there you have it.

35
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.800
The issue is now fixed.

36
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.420
I'm just going to quickly
add an execution for domain,

37
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.560
and I'll just accept the
suggestions and we're good.

38
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.720
Now let's save the file.

39
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.680
Let's move on to
the addition file,

40
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.315
which also has an error.

41
00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:57.900
Now, notice that when I open

42
00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.960
the inline chat, there's
no prompt there,

43
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.120
but if I hover over

44
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.420
the error and I open
inline chat again,

45
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.825
now I can see a prepopulated
prompt to fix this error.

46
00:02:07.825 --> 00:02:10.455
Now let's just hit "Enter",

47
00:02:10.455 --> 00:02:12.960
verify that does indeed
solve the problem,

48
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.435
and click "Accept",
and we're good.

49
00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:18.230
Let me add the
execution for domain,

50
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.790
which I'll just accept
the suggestions here.

51
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.910
Great, now it should
be executable.

52
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.690
Now I'll open the terminal

53
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.325
using the command
backtick shortcut.

54
00:02:28.325 --> 00:02:31.740
Now I'll create a new
file here, queue.py,

55
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.070
and I'll open this file
in the file editor.

56
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.390
Let me close the terminal.

57
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.470
Now I'll open inline
chat with command i,

58
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:50.380
and I'll type write
a queue in Python.

59
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.685
I'll just click "Accept",

60
00:02:53.685 --> 00:02:56.440
and that's it, we have a queue.

61
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.330
Now I'll select the class,

62
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.210
open inline chat, and type,

63
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.910
improve the code according

64
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.250
to development best
practices, and hit "Enter".

65
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.310
Now I have types in my
code which does help.

66
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.390
Now select the code again,

67
00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.250
open the inline chat,

68
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.515
and I'll type /doc
and hit "Enter".

69
00:03:26.515 --> 00:03:30.795
Now it generated a nice docu
string style documentation,

70
00:03:30.795 --> 00:03:34.465
and it also duplicated my
imports which I'll just delete.

71
00:03:34.465 --> 00:03:38.060
Now, arguably, the
best feature out

72
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.940
of inline chat is the
/test command, which

73
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.100
will generate an
entirely new file

74
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.850
with unit tests on it,

75
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.845
As you can see, it generated

76
00:03:49.845 --> 00:03:51.960
a couple of test
cases here for us.

77
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.560
Let's hit "Create", and then
close this inline chat.

78
00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.010
Let's open the file, test queue.

79
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.315
You just wrote unit
tests in blazing speed,

80
00:04:03.315 --> 00:04:05.535
thanks to GitHub Copilot.

81
00:04:05.535 --> 00:04:08.985
Now let's open the
queue file again.

82
00:04:08.985 --> 00:04:11.415
Open the inline chat,

83
00:04:11.415 --> 00:04:15.060
and let's type /explain
and hit "Enter".

84
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.230
As you can see, Copilot opens up

85
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.770
the chat panel
because it doesn't

86
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.630
do a back and forth interaction.

87
00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.860
It depends on the
chat panel for that,

88
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.950
and it provides you
with the explanation in

89
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.350
the chat panel in case you

90
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.470
want to ask any
follow up questions.

91
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.710
One limitation of inline chat

92
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.110
is the lack of back
and forth interaction.

93
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.675
Regardless, it's one of the
features I use the most.

94
00:04:36.675 --> 00:04:39.750
Great job. It should
now be easy for

95
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.390
you to get suggestions
using inline chat.
