for function bodies,

34
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.670
parameter names,
and common logic.

35
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.550
You can accept these suggestions

36
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.120
with a single keystroke,

37
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.430
often completing entire
blocks of code in seconds.

38
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.470
This saves time by reducing

39
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.190

Imagine you're working on
a web development project.

49
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.980
As you write HTML and CSS,

50
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.220
the AI tool can suggest tags,

51
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.120
attributes, and even styles

52
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.270
that fit your current context.

53
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.580

It is important to remember

60
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.920
that AI is not always perfect.

61
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.920
In fact, you must make

62
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.880
sure that you understand
the code that

63
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.920
the AI writes to ensure it

64
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.730

outdated or context
inappropriate code

68
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.200
and could misunderstand

69
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.660
the specific requirements
of your project or

70
00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.080
even introduce subtle bugs
that are hard to spot.

71
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.980
Additionally, AI
might struggle with

72
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.975
highly specialized or
cutting-edge programming tasks

73
00:03:04.975 --> 00:03:07.160
where patterns are
less established.

74
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.540
This is why you
should always review

75
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.040
and test AI-generated
code thoroughly

76
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.000
