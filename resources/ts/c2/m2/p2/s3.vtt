00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.520
Think of yourself as
a developer who can

2
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.440
effortlessly switch between
programming languages

3
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.180
without having to break a sweat.

4
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.840
That seems too good
to be true, right?

5
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.060
What if I told you
that there are

6
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.760
AI-powered tools
that can understand

7
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.180
and translate code as if it were

8
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.005
a fluent speaker of
multiple languages.

9
00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:31.620
This is actually a possibility,

10
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.515
making it easier for you to
work with diverse codebases.

11
00:00:35.515 --> 00:00:37.580
We are now entering the era of

12
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.160
generative AI and code
comprehension and translation.

13
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.020
By the end of this video,

14
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.920
you will understand how
generative AI aids in translating

15
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.720
code between different
programming languages,

16
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.800
enhancing interoperability;

17
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.000
in other words, the ability
of computer systems or

18
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.960
software to exchange and
make use of information.

19
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.460
You'll also learn how to
apply these AI tools to

20
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.425
effectively comprehend and
work with diverse codebases.

21
00:01:06.425 --> 00:01:10.550
Now, how does generative AI
apply to code translation?

22
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.950
Generative AI models are
trained on large datasets

23
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.510
containing code written in
various programming languages.

24
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.850
They learn the rules and
structures of these languages,

25
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.490
including syntax, how
the code is written,

26
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.990
and semanticsâ€”what
the code does.

27
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.850
With this knowledge,
the AI can accurately

28
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.150
interpret the purpose and
function of the original code

29
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.230
and effectively rewrite
the original code and

30
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.110
any other programming languages

31
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.905
on which it has been trained.

32
00:01:38.905 --> 00:01:42.240
You may be asking, why
is this important?

33
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.360
The primary challenge
developers face is

34
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.580
working with codebases written
in multiple languages.

35
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.760
For example, a project

36
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.840
might have its front-end
in JavaScript,

37
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.360
back-end in Python, and
some scripts in Ruby.

38
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.200
Generative AI can
bridge these gaps by

39
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.700
translating and making sense
of these diverse languages,

40
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.560
boosting productivity
and collaboration.

41
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.500
Well, how does it
work? When you input

42
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.340
a piece of code into
generative AI models,

43
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.700
these models translate using

44
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.070
their previously learned
structures of other languages.

45
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.080
This is done to maintain

46
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.840
functionality of the original
code that was inputted.

47
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.220
This saves time and reduces

48
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.475
the risk of human error
and manual translation.

49
00:02:28.475 --> 00:02:31.740
When integrating a Python-based
machine learning model

50
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.930
into a JavaScript-heavy
web application,

51
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.240
for example, manual translation

52
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.670
can be tedious and error-prone.

53
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.720
Generative AI can handle
this task swiftly,

54
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.720
ensuring accurate translation of

55
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.100
complex logic and algorithms.
How do you do this?

56
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.380
Using a generative AI tool,

57
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.000
this Python example can be

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.810
translated into
the language Rust.

59
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.490
I've entered the
following prompt

60
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.350
into Microsoft Copilot's chat,

61
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.930
and here's the response.

62
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.465
Note that Copilot can
translate the code into Rust.

63
00:03:08.465 --> 00:03:12.230
This example showcases how
seamlessly AI can handle

64
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.250
code translation
when maintaining

65
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.205
the integrity of the logic.

66
00:03:16.205 --> 00:03:17.760
Beyond translation,

67
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.330
generative AI also enhances
code comprehension.

68
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.270
AI models can generate
documentation,

69
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.530
comments, and explanations
for complex code segments.

70
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.530
But why does this matter?

71
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.710
Understanding legacy code or

72
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.010
someone else's code
can be daunting.

73
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.850
Poor documentation often
exacerbates the problem.

74
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.330
AI can generate meaningful
comments and documentation,

75
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.110
making it easier to grasp

76
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.725
the code's functionality
and structure.

77
00:03:46.725 --> 00:03:49.290
How do you apply this?

78
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.065
AI tools like Microsoft Copilot

79
00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:55.170
can analyze code and
provide explanations.

80
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.990
For example, feeding a
piece of complex code into

81
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.690
an AI model can yield a
human-readable explanation.

82
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.080
Here is the AI-generated
explanation.

83
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.030
The QuickSort
algorithm efficiently

84
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.830
sorts an array using
divide and conquer.

85
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.750
It partitions the array around

86
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.230
a pivot and recursively
sorts the partitions.

87
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.550
This is how AI
computes this result:

88
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.480
Input code: Snippet of
code in any language.

89
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.370
Code pre-processing: Cleans code,

90
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.825
handles comments,
removes white spaces.

91
00:04:30.825 --> 00:04:33.995
Syntax analysis: Examines code

92
00:04:33.995 --> 00:04:36.350
to understand structure
and generates

93
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.470
some representation,
whether hierarchical, in

94
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.630
an abstract syntax tree or

95
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.490
some other type to capture

96
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.870
relationships between
code elements.

97
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.090
Semantic analysis:
Resolves variable types,

98
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.105
calls, and control flow to
understand functionality.

99
00:04:54.105 --> 00:04:56.590
Code segmentation: Breaking down

100
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.390
the code into smaller,
manageable components.

101
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.855
Context: Understanding
context of each code segment.

102
00:05:03.855 --> 00:05:06.050
Natural language generation:

103
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.160
Generating descriptive
text for each segment.

104
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.170
Plaintext aggregation:

105
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.870
Combining all generative
descriptions of

106
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.975
a separate code block into
coherent text output.

107
00:05:16.975 --> 00:05:19.610
Output of the plain
text explanation.

108
00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.930
This process can be
invaluable for onboarding

109
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.090
new developers or maintaining
a large, complex codebase.

110
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.450
Generative AI transforms the way

111
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.170
developers work with code,

112
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.350
making it easier to
translate between

113
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.010
programming languages and to

114
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.825
comprehend complex codebases.

115
00:05:37.825 --> 00:05:39.915
By leveraging these AI tools,

116
00:05:39.915 --> 00:05:42.300
you can enhance
interoperability and

117
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.360
productivity in your
development projects.

118
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.680
In this video, we learned how

119
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.020
to translate between
programming languages,

120
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.105
learned how to comprehend
complex codebases,

121
00:05:53.105 --> 00:05:54.860
and understood that this can

122
00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.805
enhance productivity in
your development projects.

123
00:05:57.805 --> 00:06:01.600
Start integrating generative
AI tools into your workflow,

124
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.900
experiment with
translating code between

125
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.500
languages and generating
documentation for your projects.

126
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.140
You will now have the skills
to harness AI to simplify

127
00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.900
your development process and

128
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.800
open up new coding
possibilities.
