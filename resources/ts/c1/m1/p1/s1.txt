Think of a world where machines can create art, write stories, and even compose music.
Welcome to the fascinating world of generative AI, a revolutionary technology transforming industries and reshaping our future.
Whether you're curious about how AI-generated content is taking the art world by storm or you're a professional eager to leverage these advancements in your field, this video is your gateway to understanding the immense potential and implications of generative AI.

In this video, we'll uncover the basic principles of generative AI, explore its vast capabilities, and discuss its application across industries.
We'll also touch on the ethical considerations and responsibilities that come with harnessing this technology.

Generative AI only refers to algorithms that generate new content, whether it's text, images, music, or even entire visual worlds.
It's crucial to understand the basic principles of generative AI because they are the cornerstone of modern AI applications.
Understanding more about this technology can help you leverage it effectively.

It is important to remember that while Gen AI can do amazing things, like human beings, it has its strengths and it has its weaknesses.

There are many generative AI algorithms.
Most, if not all, state-of-the-art generative AI applications are powered by deep learning models like:
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- Diffusion Models
- Transformers
