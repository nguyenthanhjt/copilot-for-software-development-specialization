00:00:07.832 --> 00:00:12.028
Imagine you could write high-quality
code faster than ever before,

2
00:00:12.028 --> 00:00:14.835
with fewer errors and
less repetitive work.

3
00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:18.392
What if an AI assistant could
anticipate your coding needs,

4
00:00:18.392 --> 00:00:22.377
suggest improvements, and
even write complex functions for you?

5
00:00:22.377 --> 00:00:25.707
Welcome to the future of
development with generative AI.

6
00:00:25.707 --> 00:00:30.821
In this video, we'll explore how
generative AI, particularly large language

7
00:00:30.821 --> 00:00:36.327
model LLM chatbots like Microsoft Copilot,
can revolutionize your coding process.

8
00:00:36.327 --> 00:00:41.007
We'll dive into four key areas: code completion,
debugging,

9
00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:44.815
code comprehension, and code translation.

10
00:00:44.815 --> 00:00:49.448
We'll demonstrate how LLM chatbots
can streamline your coding process,

11
00:00:49.448 --> 00:00:52.475
ensure code quality,
and boost productivity.

12
00:00:52.475 --> 00:00:57.381
Through practical examples, you'll see how
these AI tools can become an invaluable

13
00:00:57.381 --> 00:00:59.502
part of your development workflow.

14
00:00:59.502 --> 00:01:04.392
Lets start by understanding what an LLM
chatbot is in the context of coding.

15
00:01:04.392 --> 00:01:09.352
Think of it as an incredibly knowledgeable
coding buddy, always ready to assist you.

16
00:01:09.352 --> 00:01:14.588
While you can use almost any LLM chatbot
to assist you with coding capabilities,

17
00:01:14.588 --> 00:01:18.669
for the purpose of this video,
we'll use Microsoft copilot chat.

18
00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:21.619
I'm going to start by
opening my web browser and

19
00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.364
navigating to copilot.microsoft.com.

20
00:01:24.364 --> 00:01:29.478
One of the most straightforward uses
of the LLM chatbot is code completion.

21
00:01:29.478 --> 00:01:33.810
Let's say you're working on a Python
function to check if a number is prime.

22
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.334
Instead of writing it from scratch,
you can simply prompt the chatbot,

23
00:01:38.334 --> 00:01:42.245
"complete the following Python
function def_is prime," and

24
00:01:42.245 --> 00:01:46.167
the chatbot will then generate
a complete function for you.

25
00:01:46.167 --> 00:01:51.351
But it doesn't stop there. You can ask
it to explain the code, "explain each

26
00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:57.274
line in the is_prime function, and give an
example of how it handles a specific case."

27
00:01:57.274 --> 00:02:01.370
In this way, you're not just getting
code snippets, but also learning and

28
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.486
understanding the logic behind them.

29
00:02:03.486 --> 00:02:06.422
Let's take it a step further.

30
00:02:06.422 --> 00:02:09.682
You might want to enhance this
function with error handling.

31
00:02:09.682 --> 00:02:13.430
"Enhance the prime-checking function
to include error handling for

32
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.726
non-integer inputs."

33
00:02:14.726 --> 00:02:19.063
The chatbot will modify the function,
adding robust error handling.

34
00:02:19.063 --> 00:02:23.846
This showcases how AI can help you write
more resilient code from the get-go.

35
00:02:30.372 --> 00:02:34.160
Now lets explore how AI
can assist with debugging.

36
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.434
Suppose you have a function
that's not working as expected.

37
00:02:37.434 --> 00:02:42.287
You can ask the chatbot, "debug this python
function that's supposed to calculate

38
00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:46.996
the factorial of a number but is returning
incorrect results for some inputs,"

39
00:02:46.996 --> 00:02:49.159
then paste your problematic code.

40
00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:55.723
The AI will analyze this code, identify
potential issues, and suggest fixes.

41
00:02:55.723 --> 00:02:59.271
It might point out logical
errors, off-by-one errors, or

42
00:02:59.271 --> 00:03:02.063
edge cases that you haven't considered.

43
00:03:02.063 --> 00:03:05.650
What's more,
you could ask it to explain its reasoning.

44
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.770
Explain why the original
function was staling and

45
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.822
how the suggested changes
should fix the issue.

46
00:03:11.822 --> 00:03:14.641
This not only solves
your immediate problem,

47
00:03:14.641 --> 00:03:18.337
but also helps you understand and
learn from your mistakes.

48
00:03:18.337 --> 00:03:22.752
LLM chatbots Excel at helping you
understand complex code. Let's say you've

49
00:03:22.752 --> 00:03:27.166
encountered a piece of Python code
using advanced list comprehensions and

50
00:03:27.166 --> 00:03:29.350
you're not quite sure what it does.

51
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.826
You can ask, "explain this Rust
code in simple terms and

52
00:03:32.826 --> 00:03:34.961
break down its functionality."

53
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:38.960
After pasting the code, the AI will
provide a detailed explanation,

54
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.708
breaking down complex operations
into understandable chunks.

55
00:03:42.708 --> 00:03:46.873
This is particularly useful when
you're working with legacy code or

56
00:03:46.873 --> 00:03:48.609
diving into new libraries.

57
00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:54.359
Finally, let's look at how AI
can help with code translation.

58
00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:58.276
Suppose you have a JavaScript function
that you need to port to Python.

59
00:03:58.276 --> 00:04:02.881
You can simply ask, "translate this
JavaScript function to Python."

60
00:04:02.881 --> 00:04:06.707
The chatbot will provide a Python
equivalent of your JavaScript code, but

61
00:04:06.707 --> 00:04:07.627
dont stop there.

62
00:04:07.627 --> 00:04:11.929
You can follow up with, "explain the key
differences between the JavaScript and

63
00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:13.462
Python implementations."

64
00:04:13.462 --> 00:04:15.682
This not only gives you
the translated code, but

65
00:04:15.682 --> 00:04:19.267
helps you understand the nuances between
different programming languages.

66
00:04:33.608 --> 00:04:38.557
We've seen how LLM chatbots can assist
with code completion, debugging,

67
00:04:38.557 --> 00:04:40.815
comprehension, and translation.

68
00:04:40.815 --> 00:04:43.868
These AI tools are not here
to replace developers,

69
00:04:43.868 --> 00:04:46.069
but to enhance their capabilities,

70
00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:50.401
allowing them to focus on higher-
level problem-solving and creativity.

71
00:04:50.401 --> 00:04:52.747
As you continue your coding journey,

72
00:04:52.747 --> 00:04:55.837
I encourage you to experiment
with LLM chatbots.

73
00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:59.485
Try different prompts,
explore various use cases, and

74
00:04:59.485 --> 00:05:02.221
see how they could fit into your workflow.

75
00:05:02.221 --> 00:05:07.181
Remember, the key is to use these tools
to enhance your skills, not replace them.

76
00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:07.681
