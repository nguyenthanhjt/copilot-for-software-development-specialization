## Guide: Creating Basic Code Suggestions with GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is a powerful tool that can assist you in generating code suggestions based on context. This guide will walk you through creating basic code suggestions and leveraging Copilot to streamline your coding process.

### 1. Setting Up a New File

- Open Visual Studio Code and create a new file using the shortcut `Command+N` (Mac) or `Ctrl+N` (Windows).
- Save the file with a meaningful name, such as `polish_notation.py`. Remember, Copilot uses file names as part of its context to generate relevant suggestions.

### 2. Generating Code Suggestions

- Start typing a function definition, for example, `def polish_notation`.
- Copilot will suggest the rest of the function based on its understanding of the context. You can accept the suggestion by pressing `Tab`.
- If the suggestion doesn’t meet your needs, delete it and try again. Copilot will provide alternative suggestions.

### 3. Providing Context for Better Suggestions

- Use descriptive and intentional names for functions and variables to help Copilot understand your intent.
- For example, typing `def polish_notation_without_stack` can prompt Copilot to suggest a solution that doesn’t use a stack.

### 4. Experimenting with Copilot

- Don’t hesitate to experiment with different prompts and contexts.
- For instance, you can try solving the same problem in multiple ways by providing different function names or comments.

### 5. Key Takeaways

- **You Are the Architect:** Copilot is a tool to enhance your efficiency and precision, not a replacement for your coding skills.
- **Experiment Freely:** Play around with Copilot to discover its capabilities and see what amazing things you can create.
- **Supercharge Your Skills:** Use Copilot to complement your coding expertise and streamline your workflow.
