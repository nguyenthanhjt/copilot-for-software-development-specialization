# Section 6: Explore GitHub Copilot Inline Chat

## What is Copilot Inline Chat?

GitHub Copilot Inline Chat is a feature in Visual Studio Code that allows you to interact with Copilot directly within your code editor, right where you’re working. Instead of switching to a separate chat panel, you can prompt Copilot for suggestions, explanations, or code improvements inline, making your workflow more seamless and efficient.

## Key Features and Workflow

- **Direct Interaction:** Open inline chat by right-clicking in your code and selecting "Inline Chat," or use the keyboard shortcut (Command+I on Mac).
- **Context-Aware Suggestions:** Copilot can detect errors or incomplete code and prepopulate prompts to help you fix issues quickly.
- **Voice Commands:** You can use voice input to interact with Copilot if you prefer speaking over typing.
- **Accept or Reject Suggestions:** Suggestions appear directly in your code, and you can accept, reject, or modify them as needed.

## Practical Examples

1. **Fixing Errors:**
   - When you open inline chat near an error, Copilot may suggest a fix automatically. Just hit Enter to apply the fix and review the result.
2. **Generating Code:**
   - You can prompt Copilot to write code for you, such as "write a queue in Python." Copilot will generate the code inline, and you can accept it with a click.
3. **Improving Code:**
   - Select a code block, open inline chat, and ask Copilot to "improve the code according to development best practices." Copilot will refactor and enhance your code.
4. **Adding Documentation:**
   - Use the `/doc` command to generate docstrings or documentation for your code.
5. **Generating Tests:**
   - The `/test` command can create a new file with unit tests for your code, saving significant time.
6. **Explaining Code:**
   - Use `/explain` to get a detailed explanation of a code block. Note: For more in-depth or follow-up questions, Copilot may open the main chat panel.

## Limitations

- **No Back-and-Forth:** Inline chat is designed for single-turn interactions. For multi-step conversations, Copilot will direct you to the main chat panel.
- **Best for Quick Tasks:** Use inline chat for quick fixes, code generation, or documentation, but switch to the chat panel for more complex discussions.

## Summary

Copilot Inline Chat is a powerful tool for boosting productivity and keeping your focus in the code. It’s especially useful for quick suggestions, code improvements, and generating tests or documentation on the fly. While it doesn’t support extended conversations, it’s one of the most efficient features for day-to-day coding tasks.

> **Tip:** Experiment with different prompts and commands in inline chat to discover how Copilot can best support your workflow.
