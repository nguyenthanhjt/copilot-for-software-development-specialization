# Developing a GenAI Product Strategy

Generative AI (GenAI) is a transformative technology that has the potential to solve previously unsolvable problems and drive significant productivity breakthroughs. This article explores the key considerations, strategies, and lessons learned in developing GenAI products, based on insights from Microsoft’s approach.

## Start with the Hardest Problems

When embarking on a GenAI initiative, it’s essential to focus on the most challenging and impactful problems. These are the areas where GenAI can truly shine and deliver transformative results. Avoid allocating GenAI resources to smaller, easily solvable issues. Instead, step back and rethink how core processes, such as sales or customer service, can be reimagined with AI.

### Key Takeaway

Big, hard problems offer the greatest potential for productivity gains and innovation.

## Harnessing GenAI for Product Development

GenAI is not just about the underlying technology; it’s about how you harness it to create valuable products for end users. This requires a shift in focus from backend AI engines to the user experience and front-end design. The goal is to fundamentally change how products are built and used, ensuring they solve real customer problems and add tangible value.

### Example

Microsoft’s approach to product development involves leveraging GenAI for storytelling, press releases, and envisioning new product ideas. This holistic use of AI tools enhances creativity and efficiency throughout the product lifecycle.

## Building a Common Platform

To accelerate development and ensure consistency, Microsoft adopted a unified Copilot platform. This approach prevents duplication of effort, enables knowledge sharing across teams, and ensures a baseline of security, stability, and responsible AI practices.

### Benefits of a Unified Platform

- Faster development cycles
- Shared learnings across teams
- Enhanced security and compliance

## The Importance of Dogfooding

Microsoft’s “dogfooding” approach involves using its own tools and products internally before releasing them to customers. This practice helps identify potential issues, refine features, and ensure the product meets real-world needs.

### Example

The TaskWeaver tool, initially developed for internal use, proved so valuable that it was open-sourced for broader adoption. This highlights the importance of iterative development and learning from internal use cases.

## Key Considerations for GenAI Initiatives

1. **Value Creation:** Ensure the GenAI initiative creates significant value for end users or customers. Focus on areas where AI can deliver the most impact.
2. **Business Models:** Develop clear business models and ROI calculations to justify the investment in GenAI products.
3. **Team Composition:** Assemble a multidisciplinary team with expertise in AI, systems, and user experience design.
4. **Tools and Platforms:** Leverage existing tools, platforms, and responsible AI frameworks to avoid reinventing the wheel.
