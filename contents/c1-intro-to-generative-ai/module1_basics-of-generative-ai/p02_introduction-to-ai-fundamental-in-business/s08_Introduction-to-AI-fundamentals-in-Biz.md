# Section 8: Practice Quiz: Introduction to AI Fundamentals in Business

## Question 1: In what ways is AI transforming the manufacturing sector?

- [ ] By enhancing diagnostic accuracy and personalizing treatment plans.
- [ ] By revolutionizing risk management and fraud detection.
- [x] By optimizing supply chains and predicting maintenance needs.
- [ ] By automating customer service and improving inventory management.

>  AI is transforming the manufacturing sector by optimizing supply chains, predicting maintenance needs, and improving quality control. Predictive maintenance powered by AI can foresee equipment failures, reducing downtime and costs.

## Question 2: Which of the following is NOT a capability of Microsoft Azure AI?

- [ ] Natural language processing
- [ ] Computer vision
- [ ] Predictive maintenance
- [x] Hardware design automation

> Microsoft Azure AI does not specialize in hardware design automation. It focuses on services like natural language processing, computer vision, and predictive maintenance, but hardware design automation is beyond its scope.

## Question 3: Which of the following trends highlights the importance of deploying AI models directly on devices for real-time processing and data privacy?

- [ ] AI in creative industries
- [ ] AI ethics and responsible AI
- [x] Edge AI
- [ ] Generative AI and foundation models

> Edge AI involves deploying AI models directly on devices, which allows for real-time processing, data privacy, and reduced latency. This trend is crucial for applications like autonomous vehicles, smart devices, and industrial automation.

## Question 4: What is the first thing an organization should do when starting with generative AI technology?

- [ ] Build the technology from the ground up for every application.
- [ ] Focus on the smallest and easiest problems.
- [ ] Focus solely on building end user experiences without considering backend technologies.
- [x] Start with the hardest problem that was previously considered unsolvable.

> It is advised for organizations to start with the hardest problems, as generative AI has the potential to provide the most significant productivity gains and transformative solutions when applied to these challenges.
> While foundational work is important,  the importance of not starting from scratch for every application is emphasized. Instead, leveraging a common core platform within the organization is crucial for efficiency and consistency.

## Question 5:  What is the cornerstone of business model adaptation in the era of generative AI?

- [ ] Maintaining traditional business processes without changes.
- [x] Enhancing value propositions through personalization, automation, and decision-making improvements.
- [ ] Avoiding the use of data as a strategic asset.
- [ ] Limiting partnerships to maintain complete control over generative AI technologies.

> The cornerstone of any business model adaptation in the era of generative AI is the enhancement of value propositions, achieved through personalizing customer experiences, automating content creation, and streamlining decision-making processes.

## Question 6: Which of the following best exemplifies the progression toward AI-driven code generation tools?

- [ ] Use of simple macro processors like IBM's M4 for textual substitution.
- [ ] Introduction of high-level programming languages such as FORTRAN and COBOL.
- [ ] Development of integrated development environments (IDEs) with features like IntelliSense and code templates.
- [x] The implementation of tools like GitHub Copilot, which uses AI to provide context-aware code suggestions.

> GitHub Copilot exemplifies the modern progression towards AI-driven code generation tools by leveraging deep learning models to provide context-aware suggestions, error detection, and even entire function generation, significantly transforming and enhancing the software development process.
